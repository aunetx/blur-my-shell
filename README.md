## Known bugs

### Note

This extension can be buggy, as the gnome-shell's blur implementation is quite flawed in some ways.

To entirely remove artifacts from the top panel, you can use static blur with the appropriate switch, **use static blur**.

Moreover, selecting *no artifacts* in the settings allows the blur to regenerate itself a lot better, at the expense of CPU time (adds ~3% CPU usage for the gnome-shell process in my old Thinkpad).\
**note: in Gnome 40, selecting this option is not possible for the moment**

Selecting another profile might be enought (especially if you have disabled animations), feel free to test!

### List of bugs

- artifacts on blurred parts [gnome shell bug](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/2857)
- some apps may become transparent, a weird issue...
- cannot create rounded blur
- etc (see in *issues*)

If you find other bugs, please report them!
