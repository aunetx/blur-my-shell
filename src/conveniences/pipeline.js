/// A `Pipeline` object is a handy way to manage the effects attached to an actor. It only manages
/// one actor at a time (so blurring multiple widgets will need multiple `Pipeline`), and is
/// linked to a `pipeline_id` that has been (hopefully) defined in the settings.
///
/// It communicates with the settings through the `PipelinesManager` object, and receives different
/// signals (with `pipeline_id` being an unique string):
/// - `'pipeline_id'::pipeline-updated`, handing a new pipeline descriptor object, when the pipeline
///   has been changed enough that it needs to rebuild the effects configuration
/// - `'pipeline_id'::pipeline-destroyed`, when the pipeline has been destroyed; thus making the
///   `Pipeline` change its id to `pipeline_default`
///
/// And each effect, with an unique `id`, is connected to the `PipelinesManager` for the signals:
/// - `'pipeline_id'::effect-'id'-key-removed`, handing the key that was removed
/// - `'pipeline_id'::effect-'id'-key-updated`, handing the key that was changed and its new value
/// - `'pipeline_id'::effect-'id'-key-added`, handing the key that was added and its value
